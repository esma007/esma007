👋 Hi, Welcome to my GitHub profile!  I’m @esma007
💞️ I’m passionate about cybersecurity 💻 and excited to help shape safer internet use around the globe.
👀 My professional profile is aimed at cybersecurity recruiters and private sector employers in Europe looking for a unique combination of compliance and cybersecurity skills. It's aimed at companies that are open-minded and able to train and trust newcomers.
🚀 My core values: curiosity coupled with audacity, team cohesion & collaboration, fairness & honesty. 
💬 If you ask a former employer about my soft skills: I strongly believe in team cohesion and love productive collaboration and communication, I am a good communicator both verbally and in writing. 
➕ My core strengths: I thrive the most when I learn and implement new things, I am very curious and always eager to learn and develop myself, my ability to work with people from diverse backgrounds and personalities.
💡 I’m currently learning programming languages, but also SIEM tools, security risks management, network security, and detection and response, as part of the Google cybersecurity certification. Once I finish this certification, I intend to start EITCA/IT training.
